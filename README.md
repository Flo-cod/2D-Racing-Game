# 2D-Racing-Game
This is a very early project of mine, it is done with PyGame.
You can play it by downloading all the files, if you want to change the map feel free to use or draw another ones, just the colors have to stay the same: Black for the track, red for the borders, green for the outside and white for the finish line.
